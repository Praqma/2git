# base ClearCase features

## Problem

The current base ClearCase plugin only support cases where you can list the 'snapshots' you want to migrate as a sorted list of base ClearCase labels. To release this restriction the ClearCase plugin needs improvement.

## Solution

## Implementation

In generic terms the ClearCase plugin will have more elaborate schemes to define a config-spec in order to mimic a specific way of working with base ClearCase and baselines.

## Estimate
