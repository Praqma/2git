# Problem

It seems that there are quite a lot of features available in 2git at this point, after having being working intensely with the product for a year, deploying it to two clients on two different VCS. Unfortunately the end-user documentation is not maintained at the same pace, and the entry level for new users is quite steep.

# Solution

In general the documentation will be improved, but at this point some level of shortcut to end-user involvement would come in really handy. Something that has the potential to be both entertaining and useful, and will spread easily on the web. The solution is a vblog; A short video to share on youtube.

# Implementation

A classic tutorial setup: A knowledgeable but (apparently) curious person is having a recorded conversation with an expert, who explains and shows. The A camera is on the two having the conversation, in front of a PC. The B-camera is grabbing the monitor of the PC.

The whole thing runs for less than 5 minutes.

# Estimate

All the equipment needed (camera, grabbers, editors) are already available so it's really the time it takes to prepare and shoot. Say 3 people for half a day â‰ˆ 12 hrs of work.
