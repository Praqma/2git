### Workflow

Independent of the source or target VCS, 2git follows a simple migration workflow.
The 2git DSL is used to build up a migration plan, which is then executed by the migration engine. 

* Build a migration plan
  1. Select source snapshots matching defined criteria
  2. Assign actions to selected snapshots
* Execute the migration plan
  1. Check out the next source snapshot
  2. Execute the snapshot's assigned actions
  3. Repeat

### The migration plan

The migration plan is built by defining filters in the 2git DSL.

**Filters** are used to structure your migration plan, they can contain `criteria`, `extractions`, `actions` and child `filters`.

**Criteria** are used to select your source's snapshots (commits, baselines, etc.).
Snapshots that match a filter's criteria will have that filter's extractions and actions mapped to it in the migration plan.

_Ex.:_ Created after a certain date, commit message matches a regex, etc.

**Extractions** are executed per snapshot during the actual migration to extract metadata which can be used in the actions.

_Ex.:_ Read a file's contents from your workspace, read certain commit attributes, etc.

**Actions** are executed per snapshot during the migration to perform various actions. This is where the bulk of the actual migration will take place

_Ex.:_ Commit files to git, delete some files, execute a script, etc.

#### Example migration

The following hypothetical repository contains some commits, tagged with metadata.

![commits](docs/images/workflow_1.png)

We'll define an example filter structure to build up our migration plan:

```groovy
filter {
    criteria {
        afterDate('15-05-2015')
    }
    actions {
        commit()
    }
    filter {
        criteria {
            minimumX(5)
        }
        extractions {
            custom {
                return  [myVersion: readFile('version.txt')]
            }
        }
        actions {
            tag("qualified-$myVersion")
        }
    }
}
```

The first filter selects all snapshots created past the defined date and assigns the 'commit' action to them.
The second filter, being a child of the first, _further_ filters on the selected snapshots.
It selects those with 'x' at 5 or above and assigns the custom extraction and 'tag' action to them.

The resulting migration plan that will be executed is the following:
| Snapshot | Extractions | Actions     |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| A        | N/A         | N/A         |
| B        | N/A         | N/A         |
| C        | readFile    | commit, tag |
| D        | N/A         | commit      |
| E        | readFile    | commit, tag |
