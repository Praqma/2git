# Contributing

Hi! We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing to this project. Good contributions keep this project great! This document outlines some guidelines on contributing, making it easier for your contributions to get accepted.

Note:

 * Pull requests for small changes, typo fixes etc. can will be accepted without much fuss.
 * You're welcome to open pull requests as collaboration requests, for sharing thoughts, ideas etc. 

## How to contribute

### Non-collaborators

If you are not a collaborator (yet), we suggest that you follow the typical GitHub workflow:

 * Fork the project
 * Do some work on a feature branch
 * Push the branch to your repository
 * Open a pull request to our repository
 * When a maintainer accepts your contribution, it will be merged into the repository

### Collaborators

Simply follow [Praqma's pragmatic workflow](http://www.praqma.com/stories/a-pragmatic-workflow/), consider using the [git-phlow](https://github.com/Praqma/git-phlow) git extension to make life easier.

A brief summary:

 * Work on a feature branch for your GitHub issue, e.g. `42-implement-foo`
 * Clean up your local history 
 * Push the branch as a ready branch, e.g. `ready/42-implement-foo`
 * The build server will pick up your branch and integrate it on a successful build.

### Finding a task to work on

 * Check our GitHub issues for an up-to-date list of workable tasks.
 * Some issues can be labeled with `Difficulty - easy`. This indicates the issue should be easy  to pick up for people unfamiliar with the project. We might not be there quite yet, but we will try to go that extra mile in providing better descriptions and clear scopes for these issues.
 * When you're familiar with the project, consider picking a more challenging task, leaving the easy issues for the newlings. It's tempting to burn through all the easy issues, but this quickly leaves little for newcomers to tackle.
 * Another great way of contributing is to help groom tasks, making them easier for newcomers to pick up. Suggesting solutions, relevant code locations and other helpful comments are a great help. Helping split larger issues into smaller tasks is also greatly appreciated.
